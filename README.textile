h2{color:red}. X Combat Text Plus

h4. Download

"Latest Version":https://github.com/downloads/dandruff/xCT/dandruff-xCT+v1.95.zip

h4. Description

p. xCT+ is a continuation and fork of "xCT":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info18053-xCT.html (by braindump, aka Affli).  Affli has stopped updating xCT since 4.0.6.  I'm hoping to keep this project going as long as Affli is away.

p. Overall, xCT+ is a replacement for Blizzard's scrolling combat text.  It is superior to the default combat text because xCT+ organizes incoming healing, incoming damage, and outgoing damage/healing into their own frames.

p. For those that have used Affli's xCT Add-On, xCT+ expands the functionality of its predecessor.  New features include:

* A new loot frame

* A new yell setting that allows you to yell interrupts, dispells, taunts, and more to your party or raid (coming soon)

* A grid when positioning the frames

* And more soon to come!
