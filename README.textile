h4. World of Warcraft (5.1.0 live)

p. "Latest Version - 3.0.1":https://github.com/downloads/dandruff/xCT/dandruff-xCT+3.0.1(5.1.0).zip

h3. Description

p. xCT+ is a continuation and fork of "xCT":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info18053-xCT.html (by braindump, aka Affli).  Affli is not currently updating his version of xCT.  xCT+ will continue to expand upon the features that xCT has.

p. Overall, xCT+ is a replacement for Blizzard's scrolling combat text.  It is superior to the default combat text because xCT+ organizes incoming healing, incoming damage, and outgoing damage/healing into their own frames.

p. For those that have used Affli's xCT Add-On, xCT+ expands the functionality of its predecessor.  New features include:

* An In-Game Configuration Tool

* Frames for tracking Criticals, Loot and Money, Spell Procs, Unit Power (Mana), and Class Combo Points

* A grid when positioning the frames

* Tons of new options and features

* A redesigned Spell Merger for those Spammy Spells

* Setting Profiles

* And many more exciting new features!
